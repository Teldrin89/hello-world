First training repository (GitHub Tutorial)

Hello,

I wanted to give this GitHub a try and I will try to post my tools/games code here with 2 main purposes: to spread them around and to see if some parts (or maybe even entire work) could be done better (as long as someone even decide that he/she could help) :)
I am just a beginner hobbyst (mostly) in the software develpment world but I hope this could help me advance more in key areas that I am interested in (python, R, C#).
